      <description>This research project studies multiple feature extractions in EEG recordings of various patients with epilepsy. The first approach of this project employed a multiobjective transfer learning approach to promoting joint learning among the patients and an ensemble method to aggregate the multiple feature extractions. A second approach explored a multiobjective approach that weights the influence of each feature extraction.</description>

      <description>This research project is a framework using a posteriori multiobjective optimization to train generalized linear models. To deal with the multiple models resultant from the training I explored ensemble filtering and aggregation technique. One of the strengths of this framework resides in its flexibility, being applicable to multi-class and multi-label classification, transfer learning, multi-task learning, and multi-view learning.</description>
