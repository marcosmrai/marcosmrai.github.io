Each objective function corresponds to the learning loss of a task, so that we have as many objectives as tasks. The obtained Pareto-optimal models are then explored to implement distinct learning sharing strategies: (1) by considering a single parameter vector for all tasks, the simplest learning model that could have been conceived in multitask learning, the distinct trade-offs along the Pareto frontier can be interpreted as efficient and diverse sharing perspectives for the multiple tasks; (2) those distinct sharing perspectives are then aggregated in an ensemble or the best model in the validation set is selected. Notice that using a single parameter vector for all tasks in our many-objective perspective should not be directly associated with that naive, and generally of low performance, procedure of taking all tasks as being equally related. Distinct trade-offs automatically promote the proposition of efficient and structurally diverse relationships among the learning tasks, which support a competitive performance when compared with consolidated multitask learning methods in classification problems.","tags":null,"title":"Investigating multiobjective methods in multitask classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Machine learning tools, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are then welcome to automatically generate high-performance classifiers from available data. Supported by the image datasets available at the largest online database on ant biology, the AntWeb (www.antweb.org), we propose here an ensemble of CNNs to identify ant genera directly from the head, profile and dorsal perspectives of ant images. Transfer learning is also considered to improve the individual performance of the CNN classifiers. The performance achieved by the classifiers is diverse enough to promote a reduction in the overall classification error when they are combined in an ensemble, achieving an accuracy rate of over 80% on top-1 classification and an accuracy of over 90% on top-3 classification.","tags":null,"title":"Ant genera identification using an ensemble of convolutional neural networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fernando S.

The approach is called MONISE (Many-Objective NISE), because it represents an extension of the well-known non-inferior set estimation (NISE) algorithm, which was originally conceived to deal with two-dimensional objective spaces. Looking for theoretical support, we demonstrate that being a solution of the weighted problem is a necessary condition, and it will also be a sufficient condition at the convex hull of the feasible set. The proposal is conceived to operate in more than two dimensions, thus properly supporting many objectives. Moreover, specifically deal with two objectives, some nice additional properties are portrayed for the estimated non-inferior set. Experimental results are used to validate the proposal and have indicated that MONISE is competitive both in terms of computational cost and considering the overall quality of the non-inferior set, measured by the hypervolume.","tags":null,"title":"MONISE - Many Objective Non-Inferior Set Estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This research project studies multiple feature extractions in EEG recordings of various patients with epilepsy.
